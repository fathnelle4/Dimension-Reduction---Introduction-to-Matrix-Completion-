# Dimension-Reduction---Introduction-to-Matrix-Completion-
Matrix Completion for Movie Rating Prediction

Dimension Reduction Lab

Overview

This project focuses on solving a matrix completion problem using low-rank approximation methods. The objective is to predict missing movie ratings by assuming that the underlying user–movie rating matrix has low rank.

The dataset used is the MovieLens (ml-latest-small) dataset. We implement and compare three algorithms for low-rank matrix completion:

Singular Value Projection (SVP)

Singular Value Thresholding (SVT)

ADMiRA (Atomic Decomposition for Minimum Rank Approximation)

The performance of the algorithms is evaluated using the relative reconstruction error on the observed entries.
